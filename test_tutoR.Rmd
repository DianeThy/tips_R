```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
```

This code computes the answer to one plus one,
change it so it computes two plus two:

```{r addition, exercise=TRUE}
1 + 1
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
